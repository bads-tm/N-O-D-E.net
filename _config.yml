# Use rdiscount as the markdown engine because it generates html5 compliant code for stuff like footnotes
# If you use maroku (default engine) some of your generated pages may not validate or lint as html5
# If you don't have it install it via gem install rdiscount
markdown: rdiscount

# Makes pretty (descriptive) permalinks. See Jekyll docs for alternatives.
